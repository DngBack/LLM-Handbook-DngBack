# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 🔍 Overview

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks by providing labeled training data. By fine-tuning an LLM, we can enhance its performance for domain-specific applications such as chatbots, document summarization, and code generation.

This section provides an introduction to SFT, key considerations, and practical workflows to get started.

## 📌 Topics Covered

1. **Understanding Supervised Fine-Tuning**

   - What is SFT and why it is needed
   - Differences between pretraining and fine-tuning
   - Supervised vs. unsupervised fine-tuning

2. **Preparing Training Data**

   - Formatting datasets for fine-tuning (JSON, CSV, Hugging Face datasets)
   - Labeling and curating high-quality training examples
   - Data augmentation strategies

3. **Fine-Tuning Workflow**

   - Selecting a base model for fine-tuning
   - Tokenization and preprocessing
   - Setting up training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs)

4. **Frameworks for SFT**

   - **Hugging Face Transformers** – Using `Trainer` API for fine-tuning
   - **LoRA & QLoRA** – Parameter-efficient tuning techniques
   - **DeepSpeed & FSDP** – Optimizing training on large-scale hardware

5. **Evaluating Fine-Tuned Models**
   - Choosing the right evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, ROUGE)
   - Benchmarking performance against pre-trained models
   - Avoiding overfitting and bias in fine-tuned models

## 🚀 Why Use SFT?

- **Custom Adaptation** – Improve model accuracy for specific domains.
- **Efficient Learning** – Leverage pre-trained knowledge with minimal training data.
- **Performance Optimization** – Fine-tune models for lower latency and better accuracy.
